# World-of-Valamor
My created rpg world that I'm using in an episodic campaign.

Welcome to the world of Valamor, a desert planet with rainforests, 2 polar ice caps, and oceans. There is one giant connected landmass that wraps around the entire planet and reaches from the equator to the middle of the northern and southern hemisphere. This landmass is known as the belt.
